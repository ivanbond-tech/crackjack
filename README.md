### CrackJack

A simple Blackjack emulator to aid in learning how to count cards in Blackjack.
The idea is that by playing this game enough time (and seeing the probabilities first hand) a player will be able to recognize/memorize different hand probabilities and effectively learn to count cards while playing Blackjack. Or at least be more familiarized with the probabilities of certain hands winning vs. losing depending on the variables of the game.
